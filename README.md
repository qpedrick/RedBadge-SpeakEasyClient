# The Speak Easy Application

This application is a general MVP for The Speak Easy coworking space where members can share stories and job postings,
and general users can view stories from all members.

## Types of Roles Users can have

A user by default is `general` but can be updated to `member` status by an `admin` account.

### General Role

A user with a `general` role has the ability to read all story and job postings

### Member Role

A user with the `member` role has the ability to create new job postings and edit or delete one's they have already created.

### Admin Role

A user with the `admin` role has the ability to change users' roles and to delete any story or job posting.
